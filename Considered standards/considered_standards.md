# considered standards in operations, technology and research

We have considered different standards for the designation of data points and drawn the quintessence from the existing categories and naming schemas. Above all, the requirements of the clients were taken into account. Care has been taken to ensure that the naming scheme can also be read by humans and machines.

The considered standards in operations, technology and research are:

## operations
* the Construction and Real Estate Management Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (BLB NRW) (BLB, 2014)
* the City of Frankfurt/Main (Germany) (City of Frankfurt/Main (Germany), 2016)

* the research center Juelich (Research Center Juelich, 2013)
* Munich Airport
*


## technology
* ISO 16484-6:2014
* VDI 3814 of the Association of German Engineers
* the standards of the Working group for mechanical and electrical engineering of state and municipal administrations (AMEV 2005, AMEV 2011)
* ISO 16739:2013 (Industry Foundation Classes release 4)


## research

* Project Haystack (Project Haystack, 2018)
* "Brick" (Balaji et al. 2016), a new methodology for naming building data
* standard of Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE (RÃ©hault et al, 2013)
